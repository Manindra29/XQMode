TODO List - Things which have to be done and what have been done.

O - to be pwned, X - pwned
=====================================================================================================

General
-------

O - Explore adding components to Editor window. Done to some extent. 
O - Make messages more user friendly. (Think regex) To be done after compilation check is 
	complete.
O - Eclipse like error bar on the right of the editor text area. More UI design inputs 
	from Dan, and Casey too. 
O - Import statements being ignored currently, but would need to be stored during compilation
	error check.
O - Do bad things to the troublesome ecj.jar. Hail JDT Core!
O - Class loading technique used in Mode Contribution - Investigate.
O - How to tackle bugs generated due to error line numbers that are outside the pde
	code? Like adding a } to the end of the code, causes the parser to detect the
	} added by the pre-processor as the error line. Current solution doesn't work as
	expected. Difficult one. Done. Line number in the table needs to be updated!
X - On OS X and Linux, XQMode doesn't let the PDE to start! Investigate. Ant java 
	version clash. Done.

Syntax Checker Service
----------------------

O - xyToOffset() - static or member function? It's actually used by ErrorWindow, move it there? 
X - Syntax checking works, no concurrency bugs found yet.

Error Window
------------

O - SwingWorker or synchronized for mouse event handler?
X - Handle basic/static mode offsets. After all it's used by absolute beginners.
X - Scroll to location multi tab. Done
X - Will preprocessing screw with the offsets? Yes. :( Switched back to selecting problem line.
X - Scroll to location works fine in single tab sketches.
X - Make Error Window sticky. DockTool2Base ftw.
X - Scrollable tabular view of errors, line nos.

Error Bar
---------

X - Display error as tooltip on hover.
X - Clicking on an error marker, scrolls to the error location. Done.
X - Error bar to display errors for each tab.
X - Error bar to the right of the editor. Small red rectangles as error markers.
O - Discuss the UI and aesthetics with Dan and Casey. My design looks too crappy.
