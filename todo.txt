TODO List - Things which have to be done and what have been done.

O - to be pwned, X - pwned
=====================================================================================================

General
-------

O - Explore adding components to Editor window. Done to some extent. 
O - Make messages more user friendly. (Think regex)
O - Eclipse like error bar on the left of the editor text area. Errors shown as red
	dots. More UI design inputs from Dan, and Casey too. 
O - Import statements being ignored currently, but would need to be stored during compilation
	error check.
O - Do bad things to the troublesome ecj.jar. Hail JDT Core!
O - Class loading technique used in Mode Contribution - Investigate.
X - On OS X and Linux, XQMode doesn't let the PDE to start! Investigate. Ant java version clash. Done.

Syntax Checker Service
----------------------

O - xyToOffset() - static or member function? It's actually used by ErrorWindow, move it there? 
X - Syntax checking works, no concurrency bugs found yet.

Error Window
------------

O - SwingWorker or synchronized for mouse event handler?
X - Handle basic/static mode offsets. After all it's used by absolute beginners.
X - Scroll to location multi tab. Done
X - Will preprocessing screw with the offsets? Yes. :( Switched back to selecting problem line.
X - Scroll to location works fine in single tab sketches.
X - Make Error Window sticky. DockTool2Base ftw.
X - Scrollable tabular view of errors, line nos.

Error Bar
---------

O - Error bar for each tab, with errors displayed per tab.
O - Clicking on an error marker, scrolls to the error location.
O - Display error as tooltip on hover. JComponent Tooltip property?
X - Error bar to the right of the editor. Small red rectangles as error markers.
O - Discuss the UI and aesthetics with Dan and Casey. My design looks too crappy.
O - Error markers to be static or scrollable(marker moves with the error line) ?
