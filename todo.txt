TODO List - Things which have to be done and what have been done.

O - to be pwned, X - pwned
=====================================================================================================

General
-------

O - Explore adding components to Editor window. Done to some extent. 
O - Make messages more user friendly. (Think regex) To be done after compilation check is 
	complete.
O - Eclipse like error bar on the right of the editor text area. More UI design inputs 
	from Dan, and Casey too. 
O - Import statements being ignored currently, but would need to be stored during compilation
	error check.
O - Make the sleepTime(time required per error check cycle) dynamic? What about very old computers? Lag?
O - Do bad things to the troublesome ecj.jar. Hail JDT Core!
O - Class loading technique used in Mode Contribution - Investigate.
O - How to tackle bugs generated due to error line numbers that are outside the pde
	code? Like adding a } to the end of the code, causes the parser to detect the
	} added by the pre-processor as the error line. Current solution doesn't work as
	expected. Difficult one. Done. Line number in the table needs to be updated!
X - On OS X and Linux, XQMode doesn't let the PDE to start! Investigate. Ant java 
	version clash. Done.

Syntax Checker Service
----------------------

O - xyToOffset() - static or member function? It's actually used by ErrorWindow, move it there? 
X - Syntax checking works, no concurrency bugs found yet.

Compilation Error Check (CEC)
-----------------------------

O - Process import statements to find extra libraries to be added - Buggy/May be removed completely.
X - Add all the import statements before class declaration.
X - Add Interface for CEC.
X - Figure out how/where to store the CEC. Another JAR? Or just as a .class file?
O - Classload CEC, addding the extra library jars to the classpath(url list)
	This is causing problems, the Interface is not being recognized correctly, class cast exceptions
	are getting thrown. Current workaround is adding XQMode.jar to P5 classpath. Bummer.
X - Use P5's preprocess command. My preprocess doesn't convert 0.5 to 0.5f, void draw() to
	public void draw() etc. Better off using the P5 method.
O - Compilation check should be done only if no syntax errors found. Like a 2 pass filter.	
O - Errors/Warnings from CEC to be added to the ErrorWindow Problem List.
O - Serializable warnings to filtered out.
O - Refactor SyntaxCheckerService to umm.. ErrorCheckerService?

Error Window
------------

O - SwingWorker or synchronized for mouse event handler? Synchronized working fine for now.
X - Handle basic/static mode offsets. After all it's used by absolute beginners.
X - Scroll to location multi tab. Done
X - Will preprocessing screw with the offsets? Yes. :( Switched back to selecting problem line.
X - Scroll to location works fine in single tab sketches.
X - Make Error Window sticky. DockTool2Base ftw.
X - Scrollable tabular view of errors, line nos.

Error Bar
---------

X - Display error as tooltip on hover.
X - Clicking on an error marker, scrolls to the error location. Done.
X - Error bar to display errors for each tab.
X - Error bar to the right of the editor. Small red rectangles as error markers.
O - Discuss the UI and aesthetics with Dan and Casey. My design looks too crappy.
