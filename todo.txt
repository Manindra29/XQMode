TODO List - Things which have to be done and what have been done.

O - to be pwned, X - pwned

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax Checker Service

O - xyToOffset() - static or member function? It's actually used by ErrorWindow, move it there? 
X - Syntax checking works, no concurrency bugs found yet.

Error Window

O - Scroll to location multi tab.
O - Handle basic mode offsets. After all it's used by absolute beginners.
O - Will preprocessing screw with the offsets? Tests.
O - SwingWorker or synchronized for mouse event handler?
X - Scroll to location works fine in single tab sketches.
X - Make Error Window sticky. DockTool2Base ftw.
X - Scrollable tabular view of errors, line nos.


General

O - On OS X, XQMode doesn't let the PDE to start! Critical issue!
O - Explore adding components to Editor window.
O - Make messages more user friendly. (Think regex)
O - Eclipse like rectangular strip on the left of the editor text area. Errors shown as red
	dots. More UI design inputs from Dan, and Casey too.
O - Do bad things to the troublesome ecj.jar. Hail JDT Core!
