TODO List - Things which have to be done and what have been done.

O - to be pwned, X - pwned
=====================================================================================================

General
-------

X - Add standard mode examples to example viewer.
X - processing.opengl package is not present in classpath for any Contribution - Tools and Modes! Bug?
	Sketches using OpenGL don't run from contributed modes. Fixed.
O - Explore adding components to Editor window. Done to some extent. 
O - Make messages more user friendly. (Think regex) To be done after compilation check is 
	complete.
X - Do bad things to the troublesome ecj.jar. Hail JDT Core! Ecj is past. JDT is the future.
X - How to tackle bugs generated due to error line numbers that are outside the pde
	code? Like adding a } to the end of the code, causes the parser to detect the
	} added by the pre-processor as the error line. Current solution doesn't work as
	expected. Difficult one. Done.
O - OS X Installation script needs to be updated. Doesn't work with folder names with spaces.
X - Mode menu - Pause, Resume Thread. Show/Hide Problem window.
X - Class loading technique used in Mode Contribution - Investigate.
X - XQMode crashes PDE on startup on OS X Lion! Runs fine on Linux(Ubuntu 11.10). Solved.
X - On OS X and Linux, XQMode doesn't let the PDE to start! Investigate. Ant java 
	version clash. Done.
X - Eclipse like error bar on the right of the editor text area. More UI design inputs 
	from Dan, and Casey too. 

Error Checker Service(ECS)
----------------------

X - Deal with negative line numbers(compiler errors in import statements)
O - What if compile check interface can be removed? Remember *that* blog?
O - Create a list of ignorable warnings - Discuss with Dan
	SerializableVersionID, and more. Raw type warnings?
X - Ignore Unused import warning for default imports only. Currently all unused imports ignored. Nope.
X - Handle library not found scenarios. Only error msg will be shown. No scroll to import.
O - Add support for .java tabs - lower priority.

X - Custom preprocessor almost implemented. Lots of testing required.
X - processing.video still not being added to the classpath. Investigate. Done.
X - processing libraries not being detected as Library objects. Done. 
	Reload libraries. Thanks Martin.
X - If caret line has error/warning, show in editor status.
X - Investigate error underlining/highlighting, as Martin has done in Debug mode.
X - Check if stuff from the Code folder of a sketch are added to classpath
X - Text area disappears sometimes when loading sketch on OS X. EventQueue wrongly used. Solved.
X - PDE crashes on OS X when running blank sketch in the first window that opens.
	Pause ECS on run. Solved! UIManager was the culprit!
X - Ctrl + Click on the Error Window pauses ECS thread.
X - Reload CEC files only when imports change.
X - Locate the memory sipping bug. ECS doesn't stop when Editor closed? Done. dispose() bug.
X - Syntax and compilation checking works, no concurrency bugs found yet.
X - Process import statements to find extra libraries to be added. Done.
X - Add all the import statements before class declaration - P5 preprocessor does it like a boss.
X - Add Interface for CEC.
X - Figure out how/where to store the CEC. Another JAR? Or just as a .class file? - Class file.
X - Classload CEC, addding the extra library jars to the classpath(url list)
	This is causing problems, the Interface is not being recognized correctly, class cast exceptions
	are getting thrown. Current workaround is adding XQMode.jar to P5 classpath. Bummer.
X - Use P5's preprocess command. My preprocess doesn't convert 0.5 to 0.5f, void draw() to
	public void draw() etc. Better off using the P5 method.
X - Compilation check should be done only if no syntax errors found. Like a 2 pass filter.
	Infact, even eclipse shows warnings only when code has no syntax errors!
X - mainClassOffset to be recalculated for CEC.
X - Errors/Warnings from CEC to be added to the ErrorWindow Problem List.
X - Ignore processing of java.* imports.
X - Refactor SyntaxCheckerService to umm.. ErrorCheckerService?


Messages Filter
---------------
X - All instances of the word 'token' removed.
O - Initially replaced all camel case words. But that corrects things like PApplet, MyCustomClass, etc.
	So will have to make a list of common words used by JDT.

Error Window
------------

O - Make Error Window sticky. DockTool2Base ftw. - Buggy on Windows with SketchOutline tool.
O - Problem window itself as well as columns made resizable.
X - Disable dragging/reordering of columns. Causes errors.
X - SwingWorker or synchronized for mouse event handler? Swing Workered everything.
X - Handle basic/static mode offsets. After all it's used by absolute beginners.
X - Scroll to location multi tab. Done
X - Will preprocessing screw with the offsets? Yes. :( Switched back to selecting entire problem line.
X - Scroll to location works fine in single/multi tab sketches.
X - Scrollable tabular view of errors, line nos.

Error Bar
---------

O - Discuss the UI and aesthetics with Dan and Casey. My design looks too crappy.
X - Hyperlink(Hand) cursor when hovering over error marker.
X - Display error as tooltip on hover.
X - Clicking on an error marker, scrolls to the error location. Done.
X - Error bar to display errors for each tab.
X - Error bar to the right of the editor. Small red rectangles as error markers.

Known Bugs
----------

O - Messages from processing preprocessor.
	At the end of an import statement, delete the ; and type ';
	color color = #ffffff;
O - ErrorBar.updatePoints - NPE. Add a try catch maybe.
